## 1. Introduction

**Admin Abuse (AA)** is defined as the misuse of administrative permissions granted for divisional or event needs. All players deserve an equal gameplay experience, and using moderator commands inappropriately will result in disciplinary action.

> **Important Note:** Any commands not explicitly listed as permitted in their respective categories are considered potential Admin Abuse if used/misused. Punishments may be adjusted from the guidelines depending on situation severity and context.

**For navigation:** Use the Table of Contents above or search for specific terms with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + F).

## 4. Command Severity Classification

This scale serves as a guide for NSA personnel to determine the severity of admin abuse. A command may be classified as more severe based on circumstances, leading to harsher punishment.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Any rank 1+ commands targeting large groups (via all, others, random, r6, etc.) are automatically considered "severe" and may result in USAF-wide removal.

### Harmless Commands
- All Non-Admin commands
- `;cmdbar`, `;fart` / `!fart`, `;follow`, `;logs`, `;chatlogs`
- `;pm` (to individual players only), `;host`, `;end`, `;dp`

### Minor Commands
- `;to` / `;tp`, `;bring`, `;ep`, `;refresh` / `;respawn`, `;clearhats`
- `;pants` / `;shirt` / `;hat`, `;alert`, `;sit`
- `!thanos`, `!boing`, `!headsnap`, `!lasereyes`, `;jump`
- `;r15` / `;r6` (the COMMAND, not the target), `;char` / `;unchar`
- `;h` / `;m`
- `;gold` / `;ghost` / `;shine` / `;neon` / `;glass` / `;reflectance` / `;material` / `;paint` / `;transparency`
- `;smoke` / `;sparkles` / `;fire`, `;vote`

### Moderate Commands
- `;watch` / `;view`, `;morph`, `;bundle`, `;blur`, `;warp`
- `;smallHead` / `;bigHead` / `;potatoHead` / `;headSize` / `;size` / `;dwarf` / `;giant`
- `;height` / `;hipHeight` / `;squash` / `;proportion` / `;width`
- `;fat` / `;thin`
- `;countdown` / `;countdown2` / `;hcountdown`, `;give`, `;blur`
- `;heal` / `;health`, `;speed`, `;spin`, `;nightvision`, `;dino`
- `;servermessage`, `;notice`, `;serverHint`
- `;ff` / `;unff`, `;clone`, `;rainbowFart`, `;resetteam`, `;sword`, `;jail`, `;fly`

### Severe Commands
- **Any command targeting multiple users via all/others/random/r6**
- `;mute` / `;unmute`, `;add` / `;subtract` / `;change`
- `;fogstart` / `;fogend` / `;fogcolor`, `;disco`, `;blur`
- `;god` / `;ungod`, `;visible` / `;invisible`, `;damage`
- `;freeze` / `;unfreeze`, `;ice` / `;freeze` / `;thaw`, `;lock` / `;unslock`
- `;ban` / `;directBan` / `;permBan` / `;timeBan`, `;kick`
- `;permRank`, `;tempRank`, `;resetstats`, `;fling`, `;crash`

## 5. Punishment Guidelines

Punishments are distributed based on the severity of the offense and the role of the offender. The following guidelines apply across all roles:

### Standard Progression
1. **Verbal warning** - Typically for first offenses or minor/moderate AA
2. **Suspension & admin class redo** - Length determined by severity
3. **Suspension/strikes in division/OAC** - Length/amount determined by severity
4. **Demotion in respective division/USAF** that granted mod permissions
5. **Removal from respective division/OAC/USAF**

### Role-Specific Considerations

**USAF High Command**
- May receive temporary demotion to Colonel (length based on severity)
- May face disciplinary meeting with a Senior Command representative
- May be relieved of High Command duties

**Community Staff**
- May face suspension from Community Staff duties

> **Note:** Punishment severity will be adjusted based on context, intent, impact on others, and previous offense history. Accidental misuse may be treated with leniency if properly reported.
